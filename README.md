BERT Model News Classification and Summarization
This project utilizes the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model for news classification and summarization. The project is built using a neural network and implemented using the Flask framework.

Features
News Classification: The BERT model classifies news articles into five categories: business, entertainment, sports, politics, and technology. By leveraging the power of deep learning, the model accurately predicts the category to which a news article belongs.

News Summarization: The project also provides a summarization feature, allowing users to generate concise summaries of news articles. This enables users to quickly grasp the key points and essential information from lengthy news content.

Web Scraping: The project utilizes the Selenium library for web scraping. Users can specify a category and a date range, and the system will automatically scrape news articles from relevant sources based on the provided criteria.

Usage
Install the required dependencies mentioned in the requirements file.
Run the Flask application to start the server.
Access the application through the provided URL.
Choose the desired options: classify news or generate summaries.
For news classification, provide the text of the news article, and the model will predict the appropriate category.
For news summarization, input the news article, and the system will generate a concise summary of the content.
To scrape news articles, specify the desired category and date range, and the system will automatically retrieve relevant articles from various sources.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Flask framework
BERT model and its dependencies
Selenium library for web scraping
Pretrained BERT model weights
Web browser compatible with Selenium (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)
Make sure to install the necessary dependencies before running the application.

Future Enhancements
Improve the accuracy of news classification by fine-tuning the BERT model on a larger and more diverse news dataset.
Enhance the summarization feature by incorporating advanced natural language processing techniques and algorithms.
Expand the web scraping functionality to include additional sources and customization options.
Implement user authentication and authorization for enhanced security and personalized user experiences.
Feel free to contribute to the project by providing feedback, suggestions, or code contributions. Let's work together to make news classification and summarization more efficient and effective.
